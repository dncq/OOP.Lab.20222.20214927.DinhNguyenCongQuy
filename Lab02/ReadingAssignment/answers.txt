* When should accessor methods be used?

-->  Answers:
- Accessor methods should be used whenever we need to expose the value of a private or protected field of an object to external code, in a safe and controlled way
- Accessor method should be used when the designer can guarantee that the code would be maintainable, i.e, needn't to modify every single classwhen some trivial changes arise.
