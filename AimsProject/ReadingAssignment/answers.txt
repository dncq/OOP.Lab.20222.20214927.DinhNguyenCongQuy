//Question: When should accessor methods be used?

-->  Answers:
- Accessor methods should be used whenever we need to expose the value of a private or protected field of an object to external code, in a safe and controlled way
- Accessor method should be used when the designer can guarantee that the code would be easily maintained, i.e, needn't to modify every single classwhen some trivial changes arise.  


//Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

--> Yes, as JAVA allows to create multiple constructors for a class, each with a different set of parameters

//Question:  Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
--> I would prefer the method that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, as it is much more generalized and convenient



// Question: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two 
objects still remain?
--> As this swap method just swap the copies of the two objects, not the objects themselves


// Question:  After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
--> Because we define the setter method inside of the DigitalVideoDisc class, so it will change to the value that we pass to this method.

==> Java is a pass by value programming language
