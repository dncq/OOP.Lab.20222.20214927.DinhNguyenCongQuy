//Question:  Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
--> I would prefer the method that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, as it is much more generalized and convenient



// Question: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two 
objects still remain?
--> As this swap method just swap the copies of the two objects, not the objects themselves


// Question:  After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
--> Because we define the setter method inside of the DigitalVideoDisc class, so it will change to the value that we pass to this method.
==> Java is a pass by value programming language
